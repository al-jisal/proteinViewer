Description: The proteinViewer is an app for viewing protein expression
                     in mouse. A user inputs a protein name and sees how that 
                     protein is expressed in multiple mouse strains at different
                     ages. The user has an option to see this expression in a 
                     specific group of mice (based on sex, age, or strain)
